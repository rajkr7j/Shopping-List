# shopping_list

ShopLister is an application designed to help users keep track of their grocery items through categorized lists, ensuring nothing is forgotten during shopping trips. Utilizing Firebase Realtime Database, the app enables seamless storage and synchronization of lists across multiple users. As items are checked off the list, they can be easily removed, streamlining the shopping experience. Notably, the absence of authentication means all users share the same database, promoting collaborative list management among app users.
